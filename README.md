# Radial Bayesian Neural Networks

</div>
 
## Description   
This repository contains the code for the paper [Radial Bayesian Neural Networks: Beyond Discrete Support in Large-Scale Bayesian Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00865).

We only run experiments on the MNIST dataset.

## How to run   
First, install dependencies   
```bash
# clone src   
git clone https://github.com/RomanShen/radial-bnn.git

# install dependencies 
cd radial-bnn
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```   
Next, run either convolutional or radial version MNIST experiments.   
 ```bash
# convolutional version
python run_conv.py    
```
For multiple runs with different seeds, go to [WandB Sweeps](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps/quickstart) for help.

Basically, run following commands for convolutional version.
```bash
wandb sweep sweep_conv.yaml
wandb agent your-sweep-id
```

## Results
All experimental results are available online [here](https://wandb.ai/xqshen/radial-bnn?workspace=user-xqshen).
